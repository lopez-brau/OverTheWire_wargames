# Bandit Level 0

- This level introduces players to using `ssh` to gain access to a remote server on a specified port.
- Log into the level: `ssh -p 2220 bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org`.
- Enter the password: bandit0.

# Bandit Level 1

- Log into the level: `ssh -p 2220 bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org`
- Run `cat readme` to print the contents of `readme`.
- Log into the next level using the username `bandit1` and the password from the `readme` file: boJ9jbbUNNfktd78OOpsqOltutMc3MY1.

# Bandit Level 2

- Log into the level: `ssh -p 2220 bandit1@bandit.labs.overthewire.org`.
- Run `ls` to see directory contents.
- Since `-` is a special keyword, we can append additional directory information to avoid keyword issues. Run `cat ./-` to get the password: CV1DtqXWVFXTvM2F0k09SHz0YwRINYA9.

# Bandit Level 3

- Log into the level: `ssh -p 2220 bandit2@bandit.labs.overthewire.org`
- Run `ls` to see the contents of the current directory.
- With spaces, you can rely on autocompletion by pressing tab or you can wrap the entire filename in quotation marks. Run `cat 'spaces in this filename'` to get the password: UmHadQclWmgdLOKQ3YNgjWxGoRMb5luK.

# Bandit Level 4

- Log into the level: `ssh -p 2220 bandit3@bandit.labs.overthewire.org`
- Run `ls` to see the contents of the current directory.
- Run `cd inhere` to change directories.
- Since we're looking for a hidden file, we'll need to run `ls -a` or `la` to see it.
- Run `cat .hidden` and get the password: pIwrPrtPN36QITSp3EQaw936yaFoFgAB.

# Bandit Level 5

- Log into the level: `ssh -p 2220 bandit4@bandit.labs.overthewire.org`
- Run `ls` to see the contents of the current directory.
- Run `cd inhere` to change directories.
- Since we're looking for a human-readable file, we can use the `strings` command to print the contents of a file while filtering out non-printable characters. We also need to append additional directory information to avoid keyword issues.
- Eventually, we see that running `strings ./-file07` has the password: koReBOKuIDDepwhWk7jZC0RTdopnAYKh.

# Bandit Level 6

- Log into the level: `ssh -p 2220 bandit5@bandit.labs.overthewire.org`
- We know what's in the current directory, so just run `cd inhere` to change directories.
- This directory has a ton of folders with subfolders/files of their own. We'll need to take advantage of the `find` command. Run `find -size 1033c` to find all files that are 1033 bytes in size.
- Only one file should show up. Run `cat ./maybehere07/.file2` to get the password: DXjZPULLxYr17uwoI01bNLQbtFemEgo7.

# Bandit Level 7

- Log into the level: `ssh -p 2220 bandit6@bandit.labs.overthewire.org`
- Since we have no idea where on the server the password could be, run `cd /` to change to the root directory.
- Run `find -size 33c -user bandit7 -group bandit6` to find all files on the server that pass the filter.
- A not-so-long list appears, and you can see that there's only one file that you have permission to access. Run `cat ./var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password` to get the password: HKBPTKQnIay4Fw76bEy8PVxKEDQRKTzs.

# Bandit Level 8

- Log into the level: `ssh -p 2220 bandit7@bandit.labs.overthewire.org`
- Run `grep millionth data.txt` to find the line with the password: cvX2JJa4CFALtqS87jk27qwqGhBM9plV.

# Bandit Level 9

- Log into the level: `ssh -p 2220 bandit8@bandit.labs.overthewire.org`
- We'll use piping here to execute multiple commands at once. First, we'll need to run `sort` to sort the lines alphabetically and then we can run `uniq -u` to only print non-repeating lines. Run `sort data.txt | uniq -u` to isolate the password: UsvVyFSfZZWbi6wgC7dAFyFuR6jQQUhR.

# Bandit Level 10

- Log into the level: `ssh -p 2220 bandit9@bandit.labs.overthewire.org`
